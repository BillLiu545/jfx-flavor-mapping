# jfx-flavor-mapping
This Java repos is a JFX project that allows the user to enter certain food flavors and display them in a pie chart. There are actions to add and remove flavors.

# How does it work?
Upon booting, the user sees an empty pie chart. The pie chart can only be filled in using the "Add Flavor" button - the user inputs a flavor name and its quantity to be added into the pie chart. If a flavor is already in the pie chart, its qauntity value is incremented. "Remove Flavor" button has a similar function, as after the user inputs the flavor name and quantity, the flavor already in the pie chart has its quantity value decremented; it is removed only if the quantity reaches 0. There is also a function to remove all flavors from the pie chart in the file menu.
